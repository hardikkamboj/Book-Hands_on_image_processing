## Chapter 01 

The first chapter gives an introduction to how various libraries can be used to load and play around with the images. It also shows various methods that can be applied using those libraries. There were also some advanced methods that were told without much details about them, but I guess thatâ€™s okay, otherwise, it would have been too detailed.

Finally completed the exercise for the first chapter, it was a bit difficult for me, and I had to look for solutions for some of the questions. 

While going through the chapter, I also had ideas for two of the programs that I created
